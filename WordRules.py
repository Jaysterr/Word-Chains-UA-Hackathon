# WordRules
# defines all the possible rules/restrictions for a word

#    not sure exactly how this should be structured/operated yet. 
#    But seems like it may be a good idea to seperate rules to their own file
#    so we can more easily add additional rules and such, and keep things readable
#
#    could be merged with GameManager if it turns out there isnt good enough reason to seperate
