2. **Multi Letter Match:** The same as Single Letter Match, except multiple letters will persist from the previous word.
2. **First-Last Match:** The last letter of the previous word becomes the first letter of the next word.
2. **Random Letter Match:** A random letter will be placed at a random position in the word, once again you must find a word that fits with it

The game ends when you are unable to enter a valid word within 10 seconds, or you try to use a word that you've already used. The timer resets after every word
